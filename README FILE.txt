OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 


This project focuses on utilizing Power BI to enhance safety and health in industrial settings through data-driven insights. It begins with acquiring and preparing a health dataset.
The next phase involves exploring and visualizing the data to uncover structures, distributions, and potential outliers. Also involves univariate and bivariate analyses, along with feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the data.
Two datasets Used:


1. U.S. Metropolitan Area Healthcare Dataset : 


The U.S. Census Bureau provides a comprehensive dataset capturing healthcare-related information for 83 different metropolitan areas across the United States.
 
    2) States Abbreviation Dataset:
